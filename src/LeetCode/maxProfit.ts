  You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

  You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

*/

// Sample Solution
function maxProfit(prices: number[]): number {
  let min = prices[0];
  let max = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
    min = Math.min(min, prices[i]);
    max = Math.max(max, prices[i] - min);
  }

  console.log('max', max);
  return max;
}

const prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4];
maxProfit(prices);
